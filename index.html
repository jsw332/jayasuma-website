            <h3>Message of Registrar JNTU-GV</h3>
            <p>I would like to express my deep feelings of gratitude to every one of you for your constant support, love and concern
            towards the college which enables and encourages us to strive hard to carry forward the mission of spreading value-based
            knowledge and research oriented environment to one and all. My vision is to focus on all students achieving educational
            excellence, through a rich curriculum and respectful atmosphere. We would prepare our students to become strong
            participants and leaders in the world community. I am very fortunate to work with many dedicated, innovative and caring
            staff members, parents and students. Each day is filled with new experiences, learning for all, and the ability to make
            someone’s day better. In my opinion education is the vehicle of knowledge, self-preservation and success. Education not
            only gives us a platform to succeed, but also the knowledge of social conduct, strength, character and self-respect.I am here to support the
            students, teachers and the college community.
